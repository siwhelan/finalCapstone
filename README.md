Let us assume that you work for a shoe warehouse. As store manager you are responsible for managing the warehouse, and more importantly, performing stock
taking. To optimise your delivery time and for improved organisation, you have decided to use your Python knowledge to get an overview of what each stock-taking session entailed.

This is a Python program that reads from an 'inventory' text file containing the current stock levels of the store and all relevant details of each item - including country of origin, product code and value.

The main menu of the program allows a user to read and produce a table of all data, input the deatils of a new item, re-stock the item with the lowest number on hand, search an item by product code and view details thereon, calculate the total value of each stock item and set the item with the highest stock level as being on sale.

## Installation

Run the program in your terminal, replacing the text file path with the location of your inventory file
